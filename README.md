# Dublin Dentistry project.

Hosted at: https://dublin-dentistry-43ff09.netlify.app/

This application is a static website for a dental franchise based in Dublin.  
The website was created in order to experiment with CSS transformations and animations, as well as practice creating frontend features like testimonial slideshows and popup modals.  
I also used Webpack in order to familiarize myself with using it as a build tool.
